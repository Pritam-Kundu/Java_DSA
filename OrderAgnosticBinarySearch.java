/*
 * In order agnostic binary search - we don't know whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending 
 * order but we know that the array is sorted so first we have to check whether the array is in ascending or
 * descending order.
 * 
 * Suppose an array given = [3,3,3,3,3,3,87]
 * We can check the first element and last element and then we can easily make an decsiion whether the
 * array is sorted in ascending order or descending order
